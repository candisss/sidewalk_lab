And the regions that pass the threshold are highlighted in the plot, while those regions that do not pass the threshold are shown in dark grey.

    "There are three interactive parts here and each interactive part represents one sensor, and we did not combine them into one interactive section since we divided behavior zones differently in different locations. <br />\n",
    "First, user should select two behavior zones. If user wants to see the how dwell time changes in one specific behavior zone, 1st Zone and 2nd Zone he/she chooses must be the same. For example, if user wants to see how dwell time changes in behavior zone 'Table', then both 1st Zone and 2nd Zone should be chosen as 'Table' here. The data we used here is the median dwell time of each day for this behavior zone.<br />\n",
    "If user wants to make a comparison between two behavior zones, he/she should choose two different behavior zones, and after clicking 'Apply', it will display the trend chart of the difference dwell time between the two regions. For example, if 1st Zone is 'Table' and the 2nd Zone is 'Tree', then we calculated median dwell time for behavior zone Table minus median dwell time for behavior zone Tree of each day. So if the value is greater than 0, it indicates that the for that day, the median dwell time for 1st Zone is larger than that for the 2nd Zone. In contrast, if the value is less than 0, it indicates that the for that day, the median dwell time for 1st Zone is smaller than that for the 2nd Zone. <br />\n",
    "If user wants to see the specific date or median dwell time, user can hover over that point, and it will display the date and median dwell time for that point. In addition, if user wants to magnify the line chart, there is a zoom in button on the top right corner. Also, if user wants to zoom in one specific region, he/she can creates a square, and the region within the squared will be maginified, and once the user double clicks, it will return to the original plot."
